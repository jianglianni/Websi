                            Operating systems form the backbone of information technology systems coordinating the interaction between hardware and software. Students explore the basic concepts and components of Operating Systems (OS), and how they function and interact with hardware and software components. Students examine the details of operating system structures, process management, storage management, installation, configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical assignments based on the GNU/Linux operating system. Lab work is designed to implement the theory by developing skills using the powerful GNU/Linux command-line tools and utilities.

                            The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus. Students manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems and learn the properties of and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. Students also study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent to the completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, and L.

                            Rapid changes in technology have created personal and employment choices that challenge each of us to find our place as contributing citizens in the emerging society. Life in the 21st century presents significant opportunities, but it also creates potential hazards and ethical problems that demand responsible solutions. Students explore the possibilities ahead, assess their own aptitudes and strengths, and apply critical thinking and decision-making tools to help resolve some of the important issues in our complex society with its competing interests.

                            Communication remains an essential skill sought by employers, regardless of discipline or field of study. Using a practical, vocation-oriented approach, students focus on meeting the requirements of effective communication. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and independent learning, students practise writing, speaking, reading, listening, locating and documenting information and using technology to communicate professionally. Students develop and strengthen communication skills that contribute to success in both educational and workplace environments.

                            Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an introduction to the Java programming language students use sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.
